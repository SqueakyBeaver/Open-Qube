## Contributing
Feel free to make a pull request, but make sure the pull request does not break anything or introduce any new bugs\
I may deny a pull request because it may break something I have planned. Please, do not feel disheartened if I do this to your pull request. 

## Building
You need to get a C++ compiler and install the SFML library\
You can use cmake (this includes a `cmake.txt`)\
If you do use Cmake, the executable *will* be built in the top tree, not the `build` directory or anything (though the other cmake files that normally go in `build` will still likely go in `build`)
