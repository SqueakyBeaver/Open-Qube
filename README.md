# Qube-Adventure
Just a pretty simple game written in C++ and SFML

Feel free to add anything!

# Building
You need to get a C++ compiler and install the SFML library\
You can use cmake (this includes a `cmake.txt`)\
###### **NOTE: If you use cmake, the executable will be built in the `build` directory**
